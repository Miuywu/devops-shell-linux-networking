# 0x01-shell_permissions

This project done at Holberton school San Francisco, demonstrates my basic ability to write bash scripts that run builtin commands in ubuntu terminal.

### Prerequisites

BASH shell is needed to execute these scripts.

## Installation & Use

To use these bash scripts :

0. Open up terminal
1. Clone this repository
2. Move into the directory which was just cloned
3. type "./" then the name of the file you want to run
4. hit enter key

ex. typing ./1-who_am_i and hitting enter will execute the file in BASH. This file enters the whoami command into terminal and returns the name of the current user.
## Creation

These scripts were written in EMACS within ubuntu.
