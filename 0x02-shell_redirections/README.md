# 0x01-shell_redirections

This project done at Holberton school San Francisco, demonstrates my basic ability to write bash scripts that run builtin commands in ubuntu terminal.

### Prerequisites

BASH shell is needed to execute these scripts.

## Installation & Use

To use these bash scripts :

0. Open up terminal
1. Clone this repository
2. Move into the directory which was just cloned
3. type "./" then the name of the file you want to run
4. hit enter key

ex. typing ./1-confused_smiley and hitting enter will execute the file in BASH. This file uses the echo command in terminal and prints out a confused smiley emoticon
## Creation

These scripts were written in EMACS within ubuntu.
